// what did the villager lose?



How was the dive, fish-bitten barnacle? did you find my chou chou?

WHAT? IT’S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE??

noooooo…my poor chou chou…..getting terrorised by fishies….

Also, some villager also needs your help finding their `something` down there. They’ll give you cash for finding it.

I guess you’re going to need proper equipment. Luckily, everything’s in stock. What would you like?
