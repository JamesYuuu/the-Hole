Welcome back, chum bucket. Have you ever wondered how Buraco fish taste?
@~Fast~My customers say that it’s fresh and slightly salty. The texture of the meat is firm but smooth, and it melts in your mouth.
@That’s quite different from the fish dish of my dreams: fresh Sargian Trout.
@They say that it tastes like honey smoked ribs!
@~Slow~Honey. Smoked.   RIBS!!!
@~Slow~...... ..*drooling*
@I hope they send me to Aralune on my next rotation. That’s the city closest to where they live.
@...Oh wait, you wanted to buy something right?
