Hey ho humped-backed whale. You want to ask me a thing?
@Why do I want my pillow back?
@I slept with it since I was a baby, and no matter where I am posted to, no matter what hardship I have to get over, sleeping with it makes me feel alright.
@I havenâ€™t found anything else that brings me such comfort.
@~Slow~I MISS MY PILLOOOOWWWW
