Oh hi. Sorry, i’m a little tired today.
@I was doing some major stocking system change over the past few days. The bosses were quite insistent on finishing it quickly.
@I haven’t had time to call my family, and it has been quite a while since I actually left this shop.
@Sometimes, I wonder why they want us to work so hard. It seems pointless to rush something like this. Everything is always urgent.
@Yes, I should consider myself lucky to get a job that lets me travel, but the expectations are really hard to meet.
@Those top sales reps can get a lot done, but I don’t think they ever stop to think whether their work is actually meaningful.
@Don’t tell anyone that I said that.
@Anyway, what would you like?
