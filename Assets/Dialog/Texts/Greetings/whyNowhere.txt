Hello squid snapper, what brings you here today?
@Other than the game loop, that is.
@Oh, why did I choose to work for Nowhere Express?
@To see the world of course. I want to go to all the great cities in the Seorim Empire!
@I came from a small village called Totoko, and life there was kinda boring.
@Well, except for this extremely annoying girl called Meg. She’s the mayor’s daughter.
@I wonder if she would enjoy life here.
