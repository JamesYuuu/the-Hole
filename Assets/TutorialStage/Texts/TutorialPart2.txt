it’s a grappling arm, you armless sea cucumber!
@~Fast~I don’t know HOW HQ knew that you needed one, but they sent me alllllllll the way here to sell it to you.
@.....??
@what do you mean you don’t know who I am?
@I’m NINA! Remember that name!
@You’re in my shop! Welcome to Nowhere Express!::loadShop
@We’re in Buraco village, on a tropical island southern Seorim.::disableShop
@There's a beautiful blue hole in the middle of the island. The villagers said they used to fish and swim there peacefully.
@Well, it WAS peaceful, until that day YOU went swimming in the hole.
@Actually, shouldn’t you be the one telling me all this? This is your village, your island! I’m just a travelling merchant! I just got here!
@Anyway, They said you swam after 2 lights in the water, and ... BAM! YOUR ARM WAS BITTEN OFF!!
@From that fateful day, no one dared to go swimming in the hole again.
@Today, i’m glad you finally have a replacement arm. Here you go!::tutInventory
@...and that will be 100000G.::offTutInv
@...what do you mean you don’t have enough?
@no no no, i can’t give you a discount. stop giving me those puppy eyes.
@~Slow~hmm......tell you what, i have a deal.
@Well, like it or not, you're gonna have to make some money, bucko.
@Fortunately, I've just come up with a brilliant plan!
@Alright, listen up. I'm quite an artist myself, so I'll draw it out for ya.::plan_0
@Here's the plan: I'm gonna drop you and your fancy new hand into the hole.::plan_1
@It seems that a lotta folks have dropped their precious stuff into the hole.
@Stuff that they're willing to pay a pretty penny for.
@I need you to find these items and get them back.::plan_2
@The hole's pretty big, and it'll be hard for you to swim around in there.
@Fortunately, that's what that pretty, pricey, red thing on your right arm is for.
@It'll help you zip around that underwater pit real quickly!
@~Fast~heheheh, "reel" quickly, heheh...::plan_3
@Oh, right, anyways, you might notice that there are some spooky ghost fish there in the hole.
@They're mostly harmless, with one teeny tiny exception.::plan_4
@For some reason, they get really angry whenever someone tries to take an item out of the hole.
@If they touch you, they can sap the life right out of your lungs!::plan_5
@In fact, I bet they get so angry, they'll fly right out of the water trying to chase you!
@Don't worry though. Shrewd and cunning businesswoman I am, I've also got a clever solution for this.::plan_6
@~Slow~It's a gun.
@Pick up that pistol and blast those fishies right out of the sky!
@I hear their meat happens to be pretty tasty, so I think we can make a few more dollars outta them.::plan_7
@Oh yeah, I'll also give you this to wear on your left wrist as well.
@It'll show you how much oxygen you have left in your lungs so you don't drown.
@More importantly, it'll also tell you where treasure can be found if you're close enough!::plan_8
@Got all that? Great. I'll also sell you gear here to make diving easier, if you come back with the cash.
@Now get out there and find some treasure!
