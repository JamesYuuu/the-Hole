it’s a grappling arm, you armless sea cucumber!
@~Fast~I don’t know HOW HQ knew that you needed one, but they sent me alllllllll the way here to sell it to you.
@.....??
@what do you mean you don’t know who I am?
@I’m NINA! Remember that name!
@You’re in my shop! Welcome to Nowhere Express!::loadShop
@We’re in Buraco village, on a tropical island southern Seorim.::disableShop
@There's a beautiful blue hole in the middle of the island. The villagers said they used to fish and swim there peacefully.
@Well, it WAS peaceful, until that day YOU went swimming in the hole.
@Actually, shouldn’t you be the one telling me all this? This is your village, your island! I’m just a travelling merchant! I just got here!
@Anyway, They said you swam after 2 lights in the water, and ... BAM! YOUR ARM WAS BITTEN OFF!!
@From that fateful day, no one dared to go swimming in the hole again.
@Today, i’m glad you finally have a replacement arm. Here you go!::tutInventory
@...and that will be 100000G.::offTutInv
@...what do you mean you don’t have enough?
@no no no, i can’t give you a discount. stop giving me those puppy eyes.
@~Slow~hmm......tell you what, i have a deal.
@on the way here, while getting out of the helicopter, my chou chou dropped into the hole.
@I CANT LIVE WITHOUT MY CHOU CHOU!!!
@so, if you could hop in there and grab it for me, i’ll pay for your grappling hand. Deal?
@Okay you don't really have a choice. Haha.
@oh, and there’s a HUGE market for Buraco fish meat. I'll give you $5 for each fish you blast with my gun at the surface.
@Right, that’s enough yapping from me. Time to snag that chou chou!
